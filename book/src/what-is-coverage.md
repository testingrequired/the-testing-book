# What Is Coverage?

Coverage has different meanings so lets tackle a few of them.

## Code Coverage

What percent lines and branches of code were called during the test? This is the most common definition when people say coverage and will frequently refer to it as "test coverage".

- Tests aren't always 1:1 with lines and branches in the code
- Code coverage is unrelated to the quality of the tests you have
- Requiring any level of code coverage percent will degrade quality overall

## Test Coverage

What percent of possible tests are covered?

- This is much harder to measure.
- Test coverage is related to the quality of your tests
- Obtained by composing tests across different scopes
- Every software is unique in it's test coverage requirements
